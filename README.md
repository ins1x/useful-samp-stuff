![SA:MP](https://www.sa-mp.com/images/logo.gif)  

Various useful stuff and systems for [SA-MP](https://www.sa-mp.com/) multiplayer.  
The presented systems were developed or improved by me, and implemented in working projects.  

### Pawn scripts
The filterscripts are written in the Pawn language. To build from sources, you will need the [Pawn Community Compiler](https://github.com/pawn-lang/compiler). If you use VSCode install [Pawn tools for vscode](https://github.com/Southclaws/vscode-pawn).
