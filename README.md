![SA:MP](https://www.sa-mp.com/images/logo.gif)  

Various useful filterscripts, includes and systems for [SA-MP](https://www.sa-mp.com/) multiplayer.  
The presented systems were developed or improved by me, and implemented in working projects.  

### Recommendations
The filterscripts are written in the Pawn language. To build from sources, you will need the [Pawn Community Compiler](https://github.com/pawn-lang/compiler).  
> All scripts tested on [SA:MP v0.3.7](https://www.sa-mp.com/download.php)
